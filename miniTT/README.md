# miniTT

This repo contains my implementation of miniTT with parser.

## Syntax
There're minor changes to the original syntax (mainly for parsing purpose) :

* expression variable should start with lower case, while constructor should start with upper case.

* `->` and `→` are allowed syntax for arrow type.

* `*` and `×` are allowed syntax for product type.

* a complete program consists of a series of declaration (without an expression at the end).
